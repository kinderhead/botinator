# Botinator

A framework for creating a Discord bot using `discord.js`.

## Caution

This was originally part of a Discord bot that I work on, but I figured that it would be useful to help other bots. While I make the transition, some parts might be missing, have absent documentation, or might not make sense on their own.

The separation has resulted in many *interesting* generic shenanigans in order to achieve the same type safety it had before.

## Usage
